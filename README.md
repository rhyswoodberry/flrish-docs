## The Problem

There are so many ways for aspiring developers or indie developers to sell their games these days, however, it is also harder than ever to get your games noticed. Other markets are flooded with too many games, and don't have a community that promotes innovation, development and growth of video games as a medium. 

## The Solution

A marketplace-community that is solely for indie developers or aspiring developers to showcase and sell thier games to a passionate community. The website will allow users to easily find games they will love and allow developers and their games to **flourish**.
